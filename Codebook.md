Study Design:
===============

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


Attribute Information:
=======================

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


Variables and files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

-The activity_labels.txt applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:

walking

walkingupstairs

walkingdownstairs

sitting

standing

laying


-Descriptive names of attributes are as below:

tbodyacc-mean-x 

tbodyacc-mean-y 

tbodyacc-mean-z 

tbodyacc-std-x 

tbodyacc-std-y 

tbodyacc-std-z 

tgravityacc-mean-x 

tgravityacc-mean-y

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
- A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A

# R steps to complete the project are as follows

# 1. Create one combined data set from train and test data.

tmp1 <- read.table("train/X_train.txt")
tmp2 <- read.table("test/X_test.txt")
X <- rbind(tmp1, tmp2)

tmp1 <- read.table("train/subject_train.txt")
tmp2 <- read.table("test/subject_test.txt")
S <- rbind(tmp1, tmp2)

tmp1 <- read.table("train/y_train.txt")
tmp2 <- read.table("test/y_test.txt")
Y <- rbind(tmp1, tmp2)

# 2. Pulls the mean and standard deviation for each measurement from features.

features <- read.table("features.txt")
features_index <- grep("-mean\\(\\)|-std\\(\\)", features[, 2])
X <- X[, features_index]
names(X) <- features[features_index, 2]
names(X) <- gsub("\\(|\\)", "", names(X))
names(X) <- tolower(names(X))

# 3. Provide descriptive activity names to describe the activities in the data set.

activities <- read.table("activity_labels.txt")
activities[, 2] = gsub("_", "", tolower(as.character(activities[, 2])))
Y[,1] = activities[Y[,1], 2]
names(Y) <- "activity"

# 4. Write activity labels from step 3

names(S) <- "subject"
cleaned <- cbind(S, Y, X)
write.table(cleaned, "merged_clean_data.txt")

# 5. Creates a  tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

uniqueSubjects = unique(S)[,1]
numSubjects = length(unique(S)[,1])
numActivities = length(activities[,1])
numCols = dim(cleaned)[2]
result = cleaned[1:(numSubjects*numActivities), ]

row = 1
for (s in 1:numSubjects) {
  for (a in 1:numActivities) {
    result[row, 1] = uniqueSubjects[s]
    result[row, 2] = activities[a, 2]
    tmp <- cleaned[cleaned$subject==s & cleaned$activity==activities[a, 2], ]
    result[row, 3:numCols] <- colMeans(tmp[, 3:numCols])
    row = row+1
  }
}
write.table(result, "tidy_data_set.txt",row.names=FALSE)
